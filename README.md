# Java Projects Repository

This repository contains a list of projects that I will be creating using Java. Each project is a unique exploration into different aspects of Java programming, from basic syntax and data structures to advanced concepts like multithreading and networking.

## Projects

The following is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. [CurrencyConverter](CurrencyConverter/README.md) - A Java application that converts currency from one type to another using the CurrencyFreaks API.

2. [BrickBreakerGame](BrickBreakerGame/README.md) - A game implemented in Java.


## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

## Running the Projects

Each project can be run from the command line using the `java` command. For example, to run CurrencyConverter, navigate to the directory containing the [CurrencyConverter](CurrencyConverter/) files and run:

```bash
java CurrencyConverter
```
